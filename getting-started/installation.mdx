## Install FlashMCP

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to install and manage FlashMCP.

If you plan to use FlashMCP in your project, you can add it as a dependency with:

```bash
uv add FlashMCP
```

Alternatively, you can install it directly with `pip` or `uv pip`:
<CodeGroup>
    ```bash uv
    uv pip install FlashMCP
    ```

    ```bash pip
    pip install FlashMCP
    ```
</CodeGroup>

### Verify Installation

To verify that FlashMCP is installed correctly, you can run the following command:

```bash
FlashMCP version
```

You should see output like the following:

```bash
$ FlashMCP version

FlashMCP version:   0.4.2.dev41+ga077727.d20250410
MCP version:                                1.6.0
Python version:                            3.12.2
Platform:            macOS-15.3.1-arm64-arm-64bit
FlashMCP root path:            ~/Developer/FlashMCP
```
## Installing from the Official MCP SDK

Installing from the official MCP SDK's FlashMCP is generally straightforward. The core server API is highly compatible, and in many cases, changing your import statement from `from mcp.server.FlashMCP import FlashMCP` to `from FlashMCP import FlashMCP` will be sufficient. 


```python {1-5}
# Before
# from mcp.server.FlashMCP import FlashMCP

# After
from FlashMCP import FlashMCP

mcp = FlashMCP("My MCP Server")
```
<Warning>
Prior to `FlashMCP==2.3.0` and `mcp==1.8.0`, the 2.x API always mirrored the 1.0 API. However, as the projects diverge, this can not be guaranteed. You may see deprecation warnings if you attempt to use 1.0 APIs in FlashMCP 2.x. Please refer to this documentation for details on new capabilities.
</Warning>

## Installing for Development

If you plan to contribute to FlashMCP, you should begin by cloning the repository and using uv to install all dependencies (development dependencies are installed automatically):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlashMCP/FlashMCP.git
cd FlashMCP
uv sync
```

This will install all dependencies, including ones for development, and create a virtual environment, which you can activate and use as normal.

### Unit Tests

FlashMCP has a comprehensive unit test suite, and all PR's must introduce and pass appropriate tests. To run the tests, use pytest:

```bash
pytest
```

### Pre-Commit Hooks

FlashMCP uses pre-commit to manage code quality, including formatting, linting, and type-safety. All PRs must pass the pre-commit hooks, which are run as a part of the CI process. To install the pre-commit hooks, run:

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

Alternatively, to run pre-commit manually at any time, use:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
