This document will cover how to implement authentication for your FlashMCP servers.

FlashMCP leverages the OAuth 2.0 support provided by the underlying Model Context Protocol (MCP) SDK.

For now, refer to the [MCP Server Authentication documentation](/servers/FlashMCP#authentication) for initial details and the [official MCP SDK documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization) for more.
